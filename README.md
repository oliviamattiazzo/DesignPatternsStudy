Hello!

This project contains my personal studies about Design Patterns. 
I'm currently following Alura's course about it: https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/design-patterns-dotnet

So here I have the examples developed during the video-classes and the exercises proposed by the teacher, these ones coded by myself.
The examples are in the project <strong>CursoDesignPatterns</strong> and the exercises in the project <strong>ExerciciosDesignPatterns</strong>.

The whole code is in Portugueses because the course is in Portuguese. If you need any help to translate it, please feel free to contact me!
